// // Bad example: Violation of SRP
// class Team {
//     registerTeams(user: User) {
//       // Code for saving user to database
//     }

//     sendEmail(email: string, content: string) {
//       // Code for sending email
//     }
// }
// instead of this we can use two different class for two different task which abides by SRP that is
// segregating functoins.
// This principle aims to separate behaviours so that if bugs arise as a result of your change in one function,
//  it wonâ€™t affect other unrelated behaviours.
// we have used separate class for email and team registration and handling local storage functionality as well.
// While this might seem like a lot of work, it will pay off in the long run as your codebase grows.
//  You will be able to easily find the code you need to change and make the change 
// without worrying about breaking other parts of your codebase.
// so this was the implementation of SRP principle.

// Good example: Abiding by SRP::
